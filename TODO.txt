List of things to do:
    - Better documentation (maybe use pydoc?)
    - Exception handling
    - Logging
    - Handling the steering event
    - Using and handling the ultrasonic sensors
    - Maybe later change to 833 MHz, or 2.4GHz controller instead of ps4 controller with Bluetooth
    - New hardware(buck converter for the pi's powersupply, gears, and tracks)
    - Populate README.md with a description and a list of dependencies
    - Refactor code
